    <p>
        Hello, I am Ishwar Gill. 
        I have a Master's in Biomedical Engineering and a BAchelor's in Biology.
        I am currently a student at Grand Circus in the after hours C#.NET bootcamp.
        I am currently working, but looking for a new opportunity.
        My favorite sport is basketball and I have started to get into rock climbing.<br />

    <h5>Development</h5>
    <p>
        I first started getting itnerested in programming and development the spring of 2019. 
        I enrolled into a Intro to Programming course on Udacity.
        This course taught me a bit about HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript. 
        I then decieded that I would like to expand on this and started looking around 
        and found that Grand Circus had a after hours back end course, which i was looking for.
        The resaon I chose backend was because I already had some expereince with Front end,
        and I wanted to be able to use programing along with my MAster's and Backend seemed to be better suited in the long run. 
        I am currently enjoying my time at Grand Circus

        What is a Hometown? A place where you were born or where you grew up? 
        For me, my homeotown is Sterling Hts, MI. I have lived here for over 20 years.
        I grew up in Sterling Hts and went to Stevenson High School, located in the same city.
